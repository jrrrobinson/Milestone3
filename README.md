# Inventory Management System

This project was completed in December 2017. It was made for any user who wanted to properly manage sales orders, inventory, and tasks. Since data is often imperfect, the system had to be prepared to handle abnormal formats, such as extra whitespaces or unnecessary characters that didn't belong. The error handling procedures in this program ensured that so long as the data passed was readable, the program would manage it accordingly to produce a clean output that the user could understand.
