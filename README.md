# Inventory Management System

This project was completed in December 2017. It was made for any user who wanted to properly manage sales orders, inventory, and tasks. Since data is often imperfect, the system had to be prepared to handle abnormal formats, such as extra whitespaces or unnecessary characters. The error handling procedures in this program ensured that so long as the data passed was readable, the program would manage it accordingly to produce a clean output that the user could easily understand.

In completing this project, I learned a lot about error handling, and the importance of modularity. Because large data can be handled more efficiently using vectors as opposed to standard arrays, I utilized them in my "Manager" files.

Debugging this code was challenging, but not impossible. One particular example was with Utilities. When my output was incorrect, I noticed that it was due to not defining a delimiter in the Utilities class. Although it was only one simple line of code, it was certainly very significant because without it, there is no way that this program would run according to the parameters outlined in the instructions.
